Measures efficiency of algorithm

computional complexity = time and space (memory)

Constant O(1) = growth doesn't change with input

Linear O(n) = As input growth complexity grows in relationship to input

Quadratic O(n2) = usually caused by nested loops exponential growth

Logarithmic O(logn) = inverse of exponent less effort when searching through sorted data sets

Space complexity = memory usage auxiliary space complexity = memory needed for algorithm to run without input

Asymptotic complexity = 

finding complexity = ignore non-dominant terms, ignore constants, simple variable assignments, alritmetic operations and comparisons usually constants

loops over input are Linear
nested loops are Quadratic
when can disregard large parts of input for each loop are Logarithmic
