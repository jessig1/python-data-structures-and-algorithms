trees = branching nodes that do not link linearly, represents hierarchy of objects

structure of tree
edges = connections between nodes
parent = higher up in the tree
ancestor = atleast 2 nodes higher than current node in tree
child = 1 node lower than parent
descendant = node relative to ancestory
sibiling = node at same level in tree
root = top node (only 1)
leaf = bottom node in tree (no children)
no linking of nodes on same level only 1 parent per child
common case is traversing directories or DOM markup
successor = node with next higher value in tree
predecessor = node with next smaller value in tree

Binary Search Tree = nodes only have 2 children max, values to left of node need to be less than those on the right
